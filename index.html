        <p>Hello, my name is Jeff Layfield. I am from Woodstock, Georgia and I currently reside in Canton, Georgia. I work for a Fortune 500 company as a tax accountant. I am wanting to change careers to become a web developer as I have always been fascinated about how computers operate. I am still undecided whether I want to work front-end or back-end after graduation. Time will tell in this course! </p>

        <p> Outside of work and school, my favorite hobbies are going to the Atlanta United games as I am a season ticket holder. I also like to go hiking Kennesaw Mountain, rain or shine. I enjoy hanging out with friends and family. </p>
